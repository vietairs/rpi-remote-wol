## üéØ Recommended Strategy

### Option 1: Keep homebridge-wol (Quick Start) ‚ö°
**Use Case**: You only need wake functionality right now

**Setup**:
```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "NetworkDevice",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Gaming PC",
          "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
          "ip": "192.168.1.100",
          "pingInterval": 60,
          "wakeGraceTime": 30,
          "shutdownGraceTime": 15
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Limitations**:
- You must manually configure each PC's MAC address
- No shutdown/sleep support
- Device changes require Homebridge config edits
- No integration with your webapp's device list

**When to Use**: Testing WOL functionality only, don't need sleep/shutdown

---

### Option 2: Build Custom Plugin (Recommended) ‚úÖ
**Use Case**: You want full integration with your webapp

**Benefits**:
- Automatic device discovery from webapp database
- Sleep/shutdown via SSH (your existing implementation)
- Single source of truth (webapp database)
- Status checking using your webapp API
- Add devices in webapp UI, they auto-appear in HomeKit
- Future: RDP file generation

**Effort**:
- Phase 1: API authentication (6-9 hours) - **DO THIS FIRST**
- Phase 2: Custom plugin (12-18 hours)

**When to Use**: You want professional integration, centralized management

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Pragmatic) üîÑ
**Use Case**: Use homebridge-wol now, migrate to custom plugin later

**Step 1**: Configure homebridge-wol for wake functionality
**Step 2**: Use webapp directly for sleep/shutdown (via browser)
**Step 3**: Build custom plugin when you want full automation

**Benefit**: Immediate HomeKit wake functionality while you build Phase 1

---

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Path

Since you've already installed homebridge-wol, here's the optimal path:

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Configure homebridge-wol** with your PCs (see config below)
2. **Test WOL** via HomeKit ("Hey Siri, turn on Gaming PC")

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Webapp Enhancement
3. **Add API authentication** to your webapp (bearer tokens)
4. **Test API access** from Homebridge system

### Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Custom Plugin
5. **Build custom plugin** with full integration
6. **Uninstall homebridge-wol**, install custom plugin
7. **Migrate to centralized management**

---

## homebridge-wol Configuration Example

Edit your Homebridge `config.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "NetworkDevice",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Gaming PC",
          "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
          "ip": "192.168.1.100",
          "pingInterval": 60,
          "wakeGraceTime": 30,
          "shutdownGraceTime": 15,
          "shutdownCommand": "# No SSH support in homebridge-wol"
        },
        {
          "name": "Office PC",
          "mac": "11:22:33:44:55:66",
          "ip": "192.168.1.101",
          "pingInterval": 60
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**To get MAC addresses from your webapp database**:
```bash
# SSH into your Raspberry Pi
ssh pi@100.66.154.21

# Check your database
sqlite3 /path/to/data/devices.db
SELECT name, mac_address, ip_address FROM devices;
```

---

## Migration Path: homebridge-wol ‚Üí Custom Plugin

When you're ready to migrate:

1. **Export config from homebridge-wol**:
   - Note all MAC addresses and IPs
   - These are already in your webapp database

2. **Uninstall homebridge-wol**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall homebridge-wol
   ```

3. **Install custom plugin**:
   ```bash
   npm install homebridge-pc-remote-wake
   ```

4. **Configure with API key only**:
   ```json
   {
     "platform": "PcRemoteWake",
     "webappUrl": "http://100.66.154.21:3000",
     "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
   }
   ```

5. **Devices auto-discovered**: No manual MAC address entry needed!

## Decision Matrix

**Choose homebridge-wol if**:
- You need WOL working TODAY
- You're okay with manual configuration
- You don't need sleep/shutdown automation
- You don't mind managing devices in two places

**Choose custom plugin if**:
- You want centralized device management
- You need sleep/shutdown via HomeKit
- You want device list synchronized with webapp
- You're willing to invest 20-30 hours in implementation

**Choose hybrid approach if**:
- You want WOL today AND full integration later
- You can tolerate temporary manual management
- You want to validate HomeKit workflow before building

---

## My Recommendation üéØ

**Start with hybrid approach**:

1. **TODAY**: Configure homebridge-wol for immediate WOL (30 minutes)
2. **WEEK 1**: Implement Phase 1 API authentication (6-9 hours)
3. **WEEK 2-3**: Build custom plugin (12-18 hours)
4. **WEEK 4**: Migrate from homebridge-wol to custom plugin (1 hour)

**Why?**
- ‚úÖ Immediate functionality (WOL works today)
- ‚úÖ Validates your HomeKit workflow
- ‚úÖ Time to properly implement Phase 1 (authentication)
- ‚úÖ Smooth migration path to full integration

## Next Steps

Tell me which option you prefer:

**A. Quick Start**: Configure homebridge-wol now (30 min)
**B. Full Integration**: Skip homebridge-wol, go straight to Phase 1 implementation (6-9 hours)
**C. Hybrid**: Configure homebridge-wol now + start Phase 1 implementation

Let me know and I'll proceed with implementation!
